# SOLO CHALLENGE

## TODO
- [x] Create button element on the DOM that reads 'Generate'
- [x] Use jQuery to append a <div> element when button is clicked
- [ ] Inside that <div> element, create a <p> element that shows how many times the button has been clicked
- [ ] Also inside the <div> element, append two <button> elements ('Swap' and 'Delete')
- [ ] Any <div> created using 'Generate' should have a red background color
- [ ] Clicking a 'Swap' <button> changes parent background color from red to yellow
- [ ] Clicking the 'Swap' <button> again changes background color back to red
- [ ] Clicking 'Delete' <button> removes its parent <div> container (and all of its contents)
